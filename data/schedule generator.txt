1) start a new "list" of gamedays to prep for a season
2) start with the first gameday
3) all teams should be playing each gameday
----------
FOR EACH GAMEDAY

4) pick the first team in the list
5) check if they are already playing today
6) if they arent, randomly decide if they will play a division opponent, conference opponent, or nonconference opponent.
7) if they are chosen to play a division opponent, but no division opponent is available, (either the opponents are already scheduled to play today, or they have played that team the max amount of times this season), then search for a conference opponent. 

8) if the same thing happens for conference opponents, then the team MUST find a nonconference opponent.
9) once game is found, store it in the gameday and proceed to the next team
10) once all teams have games, add the gameday to the list of gamedays and move onto the next game and repeat.
